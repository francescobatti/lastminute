This project is an search engine for flights solutions.
We just develop the business part of this project. The main class of this project is PriceCalculator.
Inside this class, we can call the method getSolutionsTravel, with 5 parameters:
- n° of adult
- n° of child
- n° of infant
- travel date
- Airport origin
- Airport destination
and this method will return a list of possible solutions.
Actually we use an predefined object to read aiport and airline and a csv file for inizialize the flights.
In an future implementation this data can be stored in DB and retrieved using an persistance protocol (JPA, Hibernate, ... ) 
the advantage to use this protocol is ti preserve the data persistance and grant to developer an level of astraction from the DB schema
An Web App or a web site can be created to allow the user to insert the input data or select this from a list and to show him the retrieved solutions
To link this View tier with Business tier, can be created an soa service , an web service or call the business part with a Restful call (JSON using Ajax)

The final architecture of this project can be like:

 >>> View Tier<<<
      service
 >>> Business Tier<<<
 persistance framework
 >>> Data Tier<<<
